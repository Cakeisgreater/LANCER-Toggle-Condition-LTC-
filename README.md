## A macro compendium containing two things: 
1) Toggles for *most* of LANCER CRB's conditions and statuses (i.e. prone, stunned, invisible, etc.)
2) A series of Worldscripts. These set defaults for certain settings. Currently contains:
  - Token image resizer ("Resizer_new")
  - Default Hex grid and token vision off for new scenes ("Scene Worldscript")
  - New conditions ("homebrew conditions") to indicate some NPC abilities. Also contains some homemade condition icons! You can easily add your own conditions. 

[Worldscripter](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/world-scripter) module recommended for installing worldscripts. 


## Installation (if you can call it that)
Contains two compendiums - "LTC - Condition Macros" and "LTC World Scripts". The former should be imported, and the latter should be added using World Scripter or setup as a world script (check foundry wiki for more!).


## recommended companion modules to improve your experience
- [Lancer Conditionss](https://github.com/Eranziel/lancer-conditions)
- [Quick Status select](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/quick-status-select)
- [Monk's little details](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/monks-little-details)
- [Dfreds Efects Panel](https://github.com/DFreds/dfreds-effects-panel)


## Things to keep in mind
- ~~The condition toggles can only be used by the GM~~. Should work for both player and GM.Thanks to Zhell on the Foundry Discord.
  - Also this doesn't require Combat Utility Belt (CUB)! In my personal experience, CUB has tendency to bug out in LANCER 1.5.3 and presents certain compatibility issues. 
- The Worldscripts can be edited to your own preference. They look terrible and amateurish because I am not a programmer. The code was frankensteined together with help from Valk, Eranziel, CSMcFarland, and others on the PILOT NET discord.
- you can always add your own conditions by adding blocks to the "homebrew conditions" world script
  - furthermore you can easily make your own toggle macros by copying the syntax. 


## Thanks to PILOT NET and Foundry Discord for help with everything.
